## About my solution

My solution is very simple when the user first visits the site, a message about cookies consent will be displayed and it will only be displayed once.

I was trying to replicate a Trustly official website. when the user clicks the get-started( kom-ig√•ng) button, a pop-up window will appear and a message will appear stating that the user can resize the window to see the width of the browser.

## what was omitted

In this project, correct lint installation with eslint and prettier is omitted because it adds more packages to the project and I want it to be very simple and there are many style guides available, different companies also have their own style guide, so I just want to do things here very simple.
